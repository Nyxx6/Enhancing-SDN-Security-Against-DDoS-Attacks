# Distributed Mobile Agent Framework for SDN Security

## Framework Overview

The proposed framework leverages distributed mobile agents to enhance SDN security against DDoS attacks, particularly focusing on data-to-control plane saturation attacks. The framework is designed to be efficient, minimally invasive to the existing SDN environment, and cost-effective.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Distribution**: Agents are distributed across the network to provide localized detection and mitigation
2. **Autonomy**: Agents operate independently with minimal central coordination
3. **Adaptability**: The framework adapts to changing network conditions and attack patterns
4. **Efficiency**: Minimizes resource consumption and overhead
5. **Compatibility**: Works with existing SDN architectures without major modifications
6. **Scalability**: Scales with network size and complexity

## Agent Architecture

### Agent Types

The framework employs three types of specialized agents:

1. **Monitor Agents**
   - Deployed on or near SDN switches
   - Collect and analyze local traffic patterns
   - Monitor Packet-In message rates and flow table utilization
   - Detect anomalies indicating potential saturation attacks
   - Lightweight with minimal resource requirements

2. **Analyzer Agents**
   - Operate at strategic network points (e.g., domain controllers)
   - Aggregate and correlate data from multiple Monitor Agents
   - Apply advanced detection algorithms (e.g., machine learning models)
   - Identify distributed attack patterns that may not be visible locally
   - Determine attack characteristics and appropriate mitigation strategies

3. **Mitigation Agents**
   - Deployed dynamically where needed during attack conditions
