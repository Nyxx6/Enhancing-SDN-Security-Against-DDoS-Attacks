                    <h2>Mobile Agent Fundamentals</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mobile agents represent a distributed computing paradigm based on autonomous software entities that can:
                    </p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mobility</strong>: Suspend execution on one host, transfer themselves to another host, and resume execution</li>
                        <li><strong>Autonomy</strong>: Operate independently without direct external intervention</li>
                        <li><strong>Goal-directed behavior</strong>: Work toward specific objectives on behalf of users or organizations</li>
                        <li><strong>Adaptability</strong>: Respond to changing network conditions and requirements</li>
                        <li><strong>Interaction</strong>: Communicate and collaborate with other agents and systems</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>
                        Mobile agents combine two key concepts: mobility and agency. The mobility aspect allows code to move closer to data sources, reducing network traffic, while the agency aspect enables autonomous decision-making and task execution.

                    <p>
                        A typical mobile agent system consists of:

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Home Platform</strong>: Where an agent originates</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Code is sent from one host to another for execution</li>
                        <li>Results are returned to the originating host</li>
                        <li>Limited state transfer, primarily code mobility</li>

                        <li>Code is executed locally after retrieval</li>

                    <p>
                        Several architectural models exist for distributed mobile agent systems:
                    </p>

                        <li>Agents organized in a tree-like structure</li>

                    <h2>Advantages for SDN Security</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mobile agents offer several advantages that make them particularly suitable for addressing security challenges in SDN environments:
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Distributed Intelligence</h3>
                    <p>
                        By distributing intelligence across the network, mobile agents eliminate single points of failure that plague centralized security solutions. This distributed approach is particularly valuable in SDN environments where the centralized controller is a potential vulnerability.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Reduced Network Traffic</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mobile agents process data locally, reducing the need to transmit large volumes of raw data across the network. This is especially beneficial in SDN environments where control channel bandwidth is a limited resource that can be targeted in saturation attacks.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Autonomy and Resilience</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mobile agents can continue to function even when parts of the network are compromised or disconnected. This autonomy enhances the resilience of the security system, allowing it to maintain protection even during attacks that might disrupt centralized security solutions.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Adaptability</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mobile agents can adapt their behavior based on local conditions and evolving threats. This adaptability is crucial for responding to the dynamic nature of DDoS attacks, which may change tactics to evade detection.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Scalability</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mobile agent systems can scale with network growth by deploying additional agents as needed. This scalability aligns well with the dynamic nature of SDN environments, where network configurations may change frequently.

                    <h2>Challenges and Considerations</h2>
                    <p>
                        While mobile agents offer significant advantages, there are also challenges that must be addressed:
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Security of Agents</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mobile agents themselves can be targets of attacks. Protecting agents from tampering, interception, or malicious hosts is a significant challenge that requires robust security mechanisms.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Performance Overhead</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mobile agent platforms introduce some performance overhead due to agent execution, migration, and communication. This overhead must be minimized to ensure the security solution doesn't impact network performance.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Coordination Complexity</h3>
